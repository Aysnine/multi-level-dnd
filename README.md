This is the last part of the 2 part blog, where I share my experience in putting together a configuration driven user interface.

The solution consisted of the actual UI that is generated by configuration and admin app where a user can drag and drop to build the configuration.
In [Part 1]() we looked at how a JSON configuration drive the UI generation, this blog specifically talks about how we built a configuration generation UI using DnD components.

## TL;DR

The Drag and Drop UI was built using [React Beautiful DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd). 
Components from [Part 1]() were used to give it a look and feel similar to the end result.
